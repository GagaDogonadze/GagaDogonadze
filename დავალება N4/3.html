        <p>The Internet is an increasingly important part of everyday life for people around the world.
             But if you've never used the Internet before, 
             all of this new information might feel a bit confusing at first.
            Throughout this tutorial, we'll try to answer some basic questions 
            you may have about the Internet and how it's used. When you're done,
